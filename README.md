# Serverless Demo

The purpose of this repo is to go over a simple monolith application and then take that same application and show what it would look like in a serverless architecture where we separate the concerns and deploy it on AWS.

This repo is used for teaching purposes and is purposefully explicit and naive in its approach.

`Note!: Do not use for real if you are worried about your donuts!`
